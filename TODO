- Coordinate release with Heiko (luatex-loader?)

all
---

- use infwarerr
- use ltxcmds?
- \lltxb as a prefix means nothing
- regression checks on the results of the tests (sed+diff the log)
    or generalise use of qstest
- add debug messages to be used in the test suite?
- mark all occurences of version-dependent stuff in the code
- quit using module() in favor of locals
- support the syntax foo = require"foo" in modutils? How?

compat
------

- import some error checking from Heiko's \LuT@MakeLuatexPrimitive?

modutils
--------

- make `\listfiles` show Lua modules? or provide \listluafiles for that

cctb
----

- support for unicode-letters?

mcb
---

- add an analogue of `callback.find()`, see #4
- revise priority system: use real numbers and don't change them
- provide a list()?
- allow temporary disabling of callbacks
- do something with open_read_file etc
- make callback.register = luatexbase_add_to_callback
- check if there are functions in the callbacks before luatexbase is loaded
  and import them

bytecode registers
------------------

- create submodule for that (really? is it useful at all?)
- only lua interface, most probably
