Here are the recommended installation methods (preferred first).

   If your are using MiKTeX, use the MiKTeX Package Manager.
   Alternatively, try you Linux distribution's package management system.

2. a. Grab the sources from CTAN or github.
   b. Run 'make install TEXMFROOT=/path/to/texmf'.
      (Warning: 'make install' without giving a TEXMFROOT will
       put files in './texmf', which is probably not what you want.)
