                  The luatexbase generic package for LuaTeX


NOTE
----
This repository contains the **Original** implementation of luatexbase.
It is kept here for the record and for checking compatibility of
newer implementations.

Most of the functionality is now provided in the core LaTeX format
(releases from 2015/10/01) or, for plain TeX, in the file ltuatex.tex.

A luatexbase package based on the new ltluatex code providing the
luatexbase interfaces is available from ctan and with development
sources at
https://github.com/josephwright/ltluatexsupp
