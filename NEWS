                    Changes in the luatexbase package/bundle

2013/06/08 v0.7
    mcb
        - minor changes and more coherent behaviour
        - refreshing the list of callbacks

2013/05/11 v0.6
    all
        - move away from the module() function (deprecated in Lua 5.2)
        - attr, loader and cctb now use provides_module
    attr
        - hack to make luatexbase and luatex.sty compatible for attribute
          allocation (same thing should be done for catcodetables)
        - adding user-defined whatsit node allocation functions (see doc)
    modutils
        - adding functions to check the availability and version of a module
        - fixing small error in module date requirement
        - update documentation to reflect the move from module()
    loader
        - do not output included file paths when called by texlua
    mcb
        - passing most of the term output to the log

2013/04/13 v0.5
    all
        - input luatex.sty before doing anything, as luatex.sty
          breaks if loaded after luatexbase
    mcb and loader
        - compatibility with Lua 5.2 (LuaTeX >= 0.74)
    loader
        - fix an important bug making the kpse lua loader never used,
          it should make package searching a bit faster.
        - dropping support for LuaTeX < 0.45.
        - small improvement to make x.y.lua look for x/y.lua, not 
          x/y/lua.
    modutils
        - fixing a bug printing "luatexbase-attr" in all documents
          in plain TeX

2011/05/24 v0.4
    cctb
        - implement catcode table stacks Ã  la luatex.sty
        - fix \CatcodeTableLaTeX(Package): 10 (newline aka ^^J) was catcoded
          15 instead of 12
        - rename \setcatcoderange to \SetCatcodeRange (the old name remains
          for compatibility but  will be removed in the next version)
    luatex 0.5
        - new package replacing luatex.sty from the oberdiek bundle
          (see luatex.pdf for details)

2011/05/21 v0.31
    attr
        - Bugfix: \unsetluatexattribute didn't work (reported by Dohyun Kim)

2010/10/10 v0.3
    [BI] marks backward-incompatible changes
    all   not using LuaTeX results in an error (formerly a warning)
    modutils
        - [BI] \luatexUseModule and \luatexRequireModule replaced by
          \RequireLuaModule with a unified syntax.
        - [BI] luatexbase.use_module removed (use luatexbase.require_module with
          a single argument instead).
        - [BI] luatexbase.module_term removed.
        - [BI] removed support for version check using a floating point
          number, only date is supported now.
        - module_{error,warning,info,log} now apply string.format
          automatically
        - date, version and description are now optional.
        - improved formatting of messages.
        - luatexbase.require_module now returns curstom err/war/inf functions.
    mcb
        - [BI] rationalise "list"-type callbacks handling. The new calling
          convention differs from the old one only in edge cases.
        - add user documentation
        - misc code tuning (more locals, etc)

2010/10/04
    - various documentation updates/fixes uploaded to CTAN
    - luatexbase.sty used to be broken on CTAN (bad docstrip)

2010/05/27 v0.2a
    attr
        - allocate from 1 to avoid problems with some external code
        - provide a Lua interface: new_attribute() and unset_attribute().
    modutils
        - fix bug with module require_module()-ed many times.
    luatexbase
        - new, loads: compat,loader,regs,attr,cctb.

[BI] Summary of backwards-incompatible interface changes between 0.1 and 0.2:
    - Lua objects are now in table luatexbase, not luatextra.
    - Lua tables tex.attributenumber and tex.catcodetablenumber are not
      created any more, use their couterparts in luatexbase.
    - \luatexsetcatcoderange has been renamed to \setcatcoderange.
    - luamcallbacks has been renamed; Lua objects are now in luatexbase,
      no more in callback.* or luamcallbacks.*
    - module error/warning etc now apply string.format to the arguments.

        - rename package, new version numbering starting at 0.2
        - functions are now in luatexbase rather than luamcallbacks, they
          are no more copied to callbacks either
        - lua objects are now local (except for the public interface)
        - test file now for plain and latex
    luatexbase-loader
        - require"foo.bar" now looks for foo/bar then foo.bar, see doc for
